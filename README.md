# Django-React Full-Stack Web App

As part of my journey into developing web applications with Django and React, I'm building this project for educational purposes. This is a learning exercise focused on understanding how these two frameworks can work together to build a full-stack application. 

I'm documenting the steps as I follow along with a YouTube tutorial playlist: [Django and React Full-Stack Guide](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kCLWnGmK0jUBmGLaJxvi4j&si=YfBI6CVFyO93lVIb).

Feel free to explore the code, leave feedback, or suggest new features I could implement!

## Features

- Backend built with **Django** (for robust backend logic and API)
- Frontend created with **React** (for dynamic and responsive UI)
- REST API integration between Django and React
- Modularized codebase with a focus on best practices for each framework

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed (for Django)
- Node.js and npm installed (for React)
